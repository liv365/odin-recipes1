    <li>1/4 pound cappicolla, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>6 ounces "baby" or fresh mozzarella</li>
    <li>1/4 pound mortadella, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 small stick soppressata (dried Italian sausage)</li>
    <li>1 small stick pepperoni</li>
    <li>1/4 pound oil-dried black olives or similar olives</li>
    <li>1 bunch fresh basil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 seedless cucumber, thinly sliced</li>
    <li><1 (5 to 6-ounce) piece of asiago or aged provolone cheese/li>
    <li>6 ounces or 2 pieces whole roasted red peppers</li>
    
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    
    <li><p>Use a separate cutting board for prepping and place a nice wooden board for the display in front of you. Unwrap all the meats and cheeses and lay them out next to your display board. </p></li>
    <li><p> Place the baby mozzarella in a small dish and set on 1 corner of the board. </p></li>
    <li><p> Roll the prosciutto like a burrito, fold the mortadella in half 2 or 3 times, and wrap the cappicolla into a horn shape and place it creatively on the cutting board. (There is no set way to roll the meats, just go with the way the meat is cut). </p></li>
    <li><p> Slice a bit of each cheese, the soppressata, and pepperoni and place on board in between folded meats. Scatter board with artichoke hearts, olives, pepperoncinis, and roasted red peppers.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>To finish, take a few basil leaves sliced chiffonade-style and mix with the minced garlic and olive oil. Drizzle over the entire board. Garnish with whole basil leaves and serve with cucumber slices as an alternative to crackers. </p></li>
</ol>
